Came up with an idea to create a database of all TVs and the parts that they
use for the purpose of organizing a tv repair business.


There are some special cases when dealing with Encompass search results. For
example, if searching for a supposedly correct part number, such as the number
seen on a Panasonic main board, Encompass will return the correct parts but
the title will not hint or mention the part number being searched. That is because
Panasonic parts have a special code that needs to be resolved before looking
up the specific part; but Encompass knows this and yields desired results.

### CGI
The basic search program will execute child processes for web requests and
post processing of the web responses.
