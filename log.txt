LOG: TV Parts and More

==========
- Beginning by parsing a product search html file from ShopJimmy. Every
product can be identified by the class value "product-name" of a header(h4)
element. Within the header element there is an anchor tag containing the
name of the product as the value of it's title attribute.

I'm thinking about implementing interprocess communication between the driver
program and the program to download and parse the webpages for potential
security reasons such as separating a malicious download from the main thread.
A more apparent reason for using IPC is to avoid termination of the main
process if there is an error with a step of the program.

==========
I may eventually call this program I'm making: "The TV Parts Query Master."
Something like that. Today is "program away" day. Screw good practices (that
don't immediately come to mind) and get things working!

10/12/2017
==========
Using get_product_names.c to get the products resulting from a search from
ShopJimmy.

==========
I'd like to eventually match up the search time with products searched for.
This can be organized by observing the time at which a page was loaded and what
was being searched for. I hope to make a database table of all the products
searched and the different times each product was searched for.

==========
- Creating an cgi folder with programs dedicated for executing cgi responses.
- I've gpt to start making programs/ functions for making http(s) requests. Is
a log a diary?


10/19/2017
==========
Implemented request_shopjimmy.c for the sole purpose of making requests to
ShopJimmy.

==========
Requests can be made to ShopJimmy via cgi. Currently testing locally.
